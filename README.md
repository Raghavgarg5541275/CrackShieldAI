## üîß Features Overview

### ‚úî Password Analysis
- Checks for lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and length
- Trained ML model predicts strength: **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**

### ‚úî Time to Crack Estimation
Estimates how long it would take to crack the password using:
- **Brute Force** (10 Billion guesses/sec)
- **Dictionary Attack** (1 Million guesses/sec)
- **Hybrid Guessing** (100 Million guesses/sec)

### ‚úî Strong Password Suggestions
- Generates **3 intelligent password suggestions**
- Allows optional inclusion of **user-specified custom word**
- Shows strength and time-to-crack for each suggestion
- **Visual side-by-side comparison** with the original password

### ‚úî Interactive User Interface
- Built with **IPyWidgets**
- Styled with HTML/CSS for professional appearance
- Real-time user feedback and validations

### ‚úî Live Cybersecurity News
- Uses [NewsData.io](https://newsdata.io/) API to fetch current news on:
  - Password leaks
  - Cybersecurity threats
  - Solutions and education
